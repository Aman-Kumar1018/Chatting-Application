# Mini Messenger Application

## Overview
The **Mini Messenger Application** is a simple, full-stack chat system built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **EJS**. It allows users to send, receive, and manage messages in a RESTful way, with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to interact with the message data. MongoDB is used for storage, while Express.js handles the backend logic and API routing.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete messages.
- **Message Management**: Tracks sender, receiver, and timestamps for each message.
- **REST API**: Allows for seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.
- **Dynamic UI**: Uses **EJS** to dynamically render message data.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for building the REST API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing message data.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML views.
- **RESTful API**: Standardized API architecture for easy integration.
